"Definition"
"The 'Other respiratory diseases' category include respiratory diseases not individually reported, such as lung dust diseases, aspiration pneumonia, bronchiectasis, deviated nasal septum, pleural diseases, pulmonary oedema, sinusitis, tonsillitis and others."
"Inclusions & Exclusions"
"Patients treated solely within the emergency department are excluded from this indicator prior to 2017/18 due to a policy change impacting hospital admission criteria from this time (PD2017_015). However, a minority of patients being managed in short stay areas of emergency departments are still included."
"Rehabilitation records are excluded to allow comparison of consistent trends over time."
"Only NSW residents are included."
"Further information about the exclusion of patients treated solely in emergency departments can be found here."
"Coding"
"Hospital separations were classified using ICD-10-AM."
"This indicator uses principal diagnosis only."
"Statistical Methods"
"Figures are based on where a person resides, not where they are treated."
"Numbers for recent years include an estimate of the small number of hospitalisations of NSW residents in interstate public hospitals, data for which were unavailable at the time of production."
"Rates were age-adjusted using the Australian population as at 30 June 2001."
"Age standardised rates (also known as age-adjusted rates) apply an age adjustment to the rates of health outcomes (usually via a standardised population) so that comparison can be made across sub-populations, diseases or time. Age standardisation is required as age structures differ across time and between sub-populations, and disease rates generally differ across the different age groups."
"Dimensions/Variables"
"Local Health Districts (LHDs) are health administrative areas constituted under Section 17 of the NSW Health Services Act 1997 which became effective from January 2011 and were initially called Local Health Networks."
"Data for some Local Health Districts (LHDs) may not be included individually due to low numbers."
"All LHDs includes LHDs where numbers are too low to be individually included, and records where the LHD was missing or not stated."
"Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are health administrative areas which represent primary health care organisations in Australia from July 2014."
"All PHNs include records where the Primary Health Network is missing or not stated as well as records assigned to the NSW portion of the Murray PHN."
"The Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia Plus (ARIA plus) is a remoteness index value (or score) based on road distance to major service centres (GISCA)."
"Statistical Areas are grouped according to Australian Statistical Geographic Standard (ASGS) remoteness categories on the basis of Accessibility/Remoteness Index for Australia (ARIA version) score."
"Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) are produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with four indexes currently being produced. Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) is the main index reported by HealthStats NSW. It includes characteristics relating to occupation, education, non-English speaking background and the economic resources of the household."
"Regional health district in NSW is defined on the basis of Local Health District (LHD) geographic areas. Details of classification are available here."
