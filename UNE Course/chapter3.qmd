## Foundations of Hypothesis Testing

Now that we’re familiar with variables and probability distributions, we can start exploring **hypothesis testing**. Hypothesis testing provides a structured framework for approaching statistical problems and drawing conclusions from data.

When performing hypothesis testing, it's helpful to reframe the problem in the context of *who*, *what*, and *why*.

Let’s refresh our understanding of a few important concepts that will be helpful in reframing our problem:

-   Target population and sample

-   Explanatory and response variables

-   Control and treatment

-   Null and Alternative hypotheses

A **target population** is the broader group you are interested in studying. In other words, *who* do you want your results to apply to?

Because it is usually not practical to study the entire population, we collect a **sample**. It is a subset of observations that represents the population.

A **response** **variable** is the variable of interest. It is what you want to measure or understand about the population. For example, if you are studying weight change after taking a new drug, the response variable is weight.

Usually, you are interested in comparing something about this variable, such as a mean or proportion of a population. This is called a **parameter of interest**.

Because it is often not possible or feasible to collect the actual parameter of interest, such as a population mean, we can estimate it from a sample with a **point estimate**, such as a sample mean or sample proportion.

An **explanatory variable** is the variable that may influence or explain changes in the response variable. In the weight example, the explanatory variable would be whether or not someone took the drug. This helps us understand *why* the response variable changes, in this case, why weight might increase or decrease.

To ensure that any observed effect (such as weight gain) is actually due to the drug and not other factors, researchers often design experiments with a **control group** and a **treatment group**. The control group does not receive the treatment, while the treatment group does. The results are then compared between the two groups.

The **null hypothesis**, denoted as $H_0$, represents the baseline assumption that there is no difference or effect. In the context of our drug example, this would mean that taking the drug does not influence weight.

The **alternative hypothesis**, denoted as $H_a$​, represents the belief that there is a real difference or effect. For the drug example, this would mean that taking the drug does have a significant influence on weight.

Test your understanding with the exercise below.

## Exercise Checkpoint 1

1.  Test your understanding with the exercise below.

    UNE Sport is trialing a new get-fit training program for UNE students and wants to verify whether the program improves the fitness of the participants.

    One hundred randomly chosen students are going to take 1 hour boot camp sessions 3 times a week for 4 weeks. At both the start and end of the month all students are going to be tested for the time in which they can run the 100m. The difference in this sprint time will be recorded.

    Match the terms below with the correct options:

2.  Now, think about the hypotheses:

    *What is the* **alternative** *hypothesis for the UNE Sport bootcamp study?*
