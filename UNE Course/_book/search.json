Or maybe you’ve tracked how long your morning commute takes so you know when to leave to arrive on time. In both cases, you are measuring something that changes, and these are examples of variables.",

    "text": "2.2 Types of Variables\nThere are two main types of variables:\n\nNumerical\nCategorical\n\nA numerical variable represents values to describe a measurable quantity. A numerical variable can be either discrete or continuous.\nDiscrete numerical variables take on distinct whole values, and are countable. For example, if we were to look at the at the number of cars in a parking lot, the number of birds in a tree, or the number of times “3” is rolled in a series of die rolls, these are exact values that can be counted and are thus discrete.\nContinuous numerical variables can take on any value within a range of real numbers. In other words, they can be measured to any level of precision. For example, age exists on a continuous scale because, in theory, it can be measured infinitely precisely. Someone could be 10.25, 10.257, or even 10.2576326362 years old. In everyday life, we usually round age to the nearest year, but that does not change the fact that the underlying variable is continuous. Other common examples of continuous numerical variables include weight, height, and time. Can you explain why each of these variables is numerical and continuous?\nA categorical variable, on the other hand, represents categories or labels that describe a quality or characteristic. Categorical variables can be either nominal or ordinal.\nA nominal categorical variable includes observations with no particular order. For example, if you asked ten coworkers for their favorite movie and recorded their answers under a “movies” variable, it would be nominal because there is no inherent sequence or ranking among the movie titles.\nIn an ordinal categorical variable, there is an inherent logical order to the observations. For example, if we collected age groups such as “18–24”, “25–38”, “39–55”, “56–70”, and “70+”, we’re now working with labels that have a built-in order where “18–24” is younger than “25–38”, and so on.\nAnother example might be asking people whether they like ice cream, with options like “strongly agree”, “agree”, “neutral”, “disagree”, and “strongly disagree”. In this case, the order of the options has meaning, even if the distance between them isn’t equal.\nTake a moment to check your understanding with the exercises below.",
