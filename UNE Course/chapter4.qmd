title: "t-tests: one sample and two sample"
---

We will be covering a number of statistical tests throughout this course. Which statistical test you choose, depends on the type of experiment or study has been conducted and what type of data we have. In this chapter, we will specifically focus on applying one-sample and two-sample t-tests.

Instead of using the normal (Z) distribution, t-tests use the t-distribution. This is because t-tests are usually based on smaller sample sizes, so we need to account for extra uncertainty in the standard error and critical values. As the sample size gets bigger, the t-distribution becomes almost identical to the Z-distribution, as can be seen below.

Like the previous chapter, we can use a hypothesis testing framework to approach our research questions.

Before starting this lesson, you'll need to download some data.

Let's apply our skills to some real data provided by the NSW Government, and see how even the skills we have learnt in three chapters can already be useful to the real world.

[Data.NSW](https://data.nsw.gov.au/) is an open data poral with over 16,724 NSW public sector datasets to download. You can also access additional Open Data Portals listed here:

-   [API.NSW](https://api.nsw.gov.au/)

-   [Environmental Data Portal, SEED](https://www.seed.nsw.gov.au/)
